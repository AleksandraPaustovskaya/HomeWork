Indexes are essential for the efficient processing of database
workloads. Proposed solutions for the relevant and challenging index selection problem range from metadata-based
simple heuristics, over sophisticated multi-step algorithms,
to approaches that yield optimal results. The main challenges are (i) to accurately determine the effect of an index
on the workload cost while considering the interaction of
indexes and (ii) a large number of possible combinations resulting from workloads containing many queries and massive
schemata with possibly thousands of attributes.
